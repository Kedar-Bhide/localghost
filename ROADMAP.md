# LocalGhost MVP Development Roadmap

*Feature-by-feature development plan for production-ready MVP launch*

---

## üéØ Development Philosophy

Each prompt delivers a **complete, testable feature** including database, backend API, and frontend UI. Features build logically on each other and align with our UX specification and database schema.

**Testing Approach**: After each feature, test locally. Deploy to production after logical groupings.

## üöÄ **Deployment Strategy**

### **Development Cycle:**
1. Implement feature locally
2. Test feature functionality
3. Deploy feature to production (at checkpoints)
4. Verify production deployment
5. Move to next feature

### **Production Deployments:**
- **Checkpoint 1** (After P1.3): Core auth system
- **Checkpoint 2** (After P2.2): Search and discovery  
- **Checkpoint 3** (After P3.2): Real-time messaging
- **Checkpoint 4** (After P4.2): Complete core MVP
- **Final Deployment** (After P5.3): Full-featured MVP
- **Launch Ready** (After P6.3): Production-hardened MVP

### **Testing Protocol:**
- **Local Testing**: After each individual prompt
- **Integration Testing**: Before each deployment checkpoint
- **Production Testing**: After each deployment checkpoint
- **User Acceptance**: Before final launch
